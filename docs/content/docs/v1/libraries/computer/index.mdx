**@cua/computer** is a Computer-Use Interface (CUI) framework powering Cua for interacting with local macOS and Linux sandboxes. It's PyAutoGUI-compatible and pluggable with any AI agent systems (Cua, Langchain, CrewAI, AutoGen). Computer relies on [Lume](https://github.com/trycua/lume) for creating and managing sandbox environments.
