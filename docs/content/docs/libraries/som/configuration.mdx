### Detection Parameters

#### Box Threshold (0.3)
Controls the confidence threshold for accepting detections:
```
High Threshold (0.3):     Low Threshold (0.01):
+----------------+        +----------------+
|                |        |  +--------+    |
|   Confident    |        |  |Unsure?|    |
|   Detection    |        |  +--------+    |
|   (✓ Accept)   |        |  (? Reject)   |
|                |        |                |
+----------------+        +----------------+
conf = 0.85             conf = 0.02
```
- Higher values (0.3) yield more precise but fewer detections
- Lower values (0.01) catch more potential icons but increase false positives
- Default is 0.3 for optimal precision/recall balance

#### IOU Threshold (0.1)
Controls how overlapping detections are merged:
```
IOU = Intersection Area / Union Area

Low Overlap (Keep Both):   High Overlap (Merge):
+----------+              +----------+
|     Box1 |              |  Box1   |
|          |     vs.      |+-----+  |
+----------+              ||Box2 |  |
    +----------+          |+-----+  |
    |   Box2   |          +----------+
    |          |
    +----------+
IOU ≈ 0.05 (Keep Both)    IOU ≈ 0.7 (Merge)
```
- Lower values (0.1) more aggressively remove overlapping boxes
- Higher values (0.5) allow more overlapping detections
- Default is 0.1 to handle densely packed UI elements

### OCR Configuration

- **Engine**: EasyOCR
  - Primary choice for all platforms
  - Fast initialization and processing
  - Built-in English language support
  - GPU acceleration when available

- **Settings**:
  - Timeout: 5 seconds
  - Confidence threshold: 0.5
  - Paragraph mode: Disabled
  - Language: English only

## Performance

### Hardware Acceleration

#### MPS (Metal Performance Shaders)
- Multi-scale detection (640px, 1280px, 1920px)
- Test-time augmentation enabled
- Half-precision (FP16)
- Average detection time: ~0.4s
- Best for production use when available

#### CPU
- Single-scale detection (1280px)
- Full-precision (FP32)
- Average detection time: ~1.3s
- Reliable fallback option
