**Lumier** is an interface for running macOS virtual machines with minimal setup. It uses Docker as a packaging system to deliver a pre-configured environment that connects to the `lume` virtualization service running on your host machine. With Lumier, you get:

- A ready-to-use macOS or Linux virtual machine in minutes
- Browser-based VNC access to your VM
- Easy file sharing between your host and VM
- Simple configuration through environment variables
