title: Computer-Use Agent Quickstart
description: Launch a computer-use agent UI interface with Docker, Dev Container, or Python.
---

## Docker

_Best for a simple, fully managed installation for testing and experimentation._

**macOS/Linux/Windows (via WSL):**

Run the following command to setup the Docker containers and launch the Computer-Use Agent UI:

```bash
# Requires Docker
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trycua/cua/main/scripts/playground-docker.sh)"
```

## Dev Container

_Best for contributors and active development._

Visit the [Dev Container](./dev-container-setup) guide to use the configuration that simplifies development setup to a few steps.

## PyPI

_Direct Python package installation_

```bash
# conda create -yn cua python==3.12

pip install -U "cua-computer[all]" "cua-agent[all]"
python -m agent.ui # Start the agent UI
```

Or check out the [Usage Guide](./cua-usage-guide) to learn how to use our Python SDK in your own code.
