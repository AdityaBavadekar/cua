Get up and running with the c/ua Agent UI in 5 simple steps.

## 1. Introduction

c/ua combines Computer (interface) + Agent (AI) for automating desktop apps. The Agent UI provides a simple chat interface to control your remote computer using natural language.

## 2. Create Your First c/ua Container

1. Go to [trycua.com/signin](https://www.trycua.com/signin)
2. Navigate to **Dashboard > Containers > Create Instance**
3. Create a **Medium, Ubuntu 22** container
4. Note your container name and API key

## 3. Install c/ua

```bash
pip install "cua-agent[all]" cua-computer
```

## 4. Run the Agent UI

```bash
python -m agent.ui
```

## 5. Start Chatting

Open your browser to the displayed URL and start chatting with your computer-using agent.

You can ask your agent to perform actions like:
- "Open Firefox and go to github.com"
- "Take a screenshot and tell me what's on the screen"
- "Type 'Hello world' into the terminal"
