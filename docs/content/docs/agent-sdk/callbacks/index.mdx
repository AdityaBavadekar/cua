title: Callbacks
---

Callbacks in the Agent SDK provide hooks into the agent's lifecycle, allowing for custom functionality to be executed at various stages of an agent's run. They enable extensibility by allowing developers to integrate their own logic for tasks such as logging, cost management, and data anonymization.

The callback lifecycle is described in [Agent Lifecycle](callbacks/agent-lifecycle).

## Built-in Callbacks

- [BudgetManagerCallback](callbacks/cost-saving): Stops execution when budget exceeded
- [LoggingCallback](callbacks/trajectories): Logs agent activities
- **ImageRetentionCallback**: Limits recent images in context
- **TrajectorySaverCallback**: Saves conversation trajectories
- [PII Anonymization](callbacks/pii-anonymization)
