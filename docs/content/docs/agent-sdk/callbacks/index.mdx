title: Callbacks
---

Callbacks in the Agent SDK provide hooks into the agent's lifecycle, allowing for custom functionality to be executed at various stages of an agent's run. They enable extensibility by allowing developers to integrate their own logic for tasks such as logging, cost management, and data anonymization.

This section details the various callbacks available in the Agent SDK.

## Available Callbacks

- [Cost Saving](callbacks/cost-saving)
- [Logging](callbacks/logging)
- [PII Anonymization](callbacks/pii-anonymization)
- [Trajectories](callbacks/trajectories)
